    <Typography title="Bridging the Gap Between Physical and Digital">
    Real-world token assets represent a revolutionary shift in how we interact with tangible goods and commodities. By utilizing blockchain technology,
     these tokenized assets forge an unbreakable connection   between a physical item and its digital representation.
     
  </Typography>
  <Typography title="Immutability and Transparency">
  One of the key benefits is the immutable nature of blockchain records.
  Once a real-world asset is tokenized, its history, ownership, and important characteristics are recorded in a transparent and 
  unalterable manner. This eliminates the risks associated with counterfeiting and fraud.
  </Typography>
  <Typography title="Democratizing Investment">
    Tokenization can divide a high-value physical asset into smaller, 
    more affordable shares. This process democratizes investment and
      ownership, allowing a broader range of individuals to participate in markets that may have 
    been inaccessible due to high entry costs, such as real estate or fine art.
