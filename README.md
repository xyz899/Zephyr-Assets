# ZephyrAssets: Real-World Asset Tokenization Platform

## 🚀 Overview

ZephyrAssets is a next-generation platform designed to revolutionize how real-world assets are bought, sold, and managed. Leveraging blockchain technology, we tokenize various types of physical assets such as real estate, cars, art, and even NFTs, to make them more liquid, easily transferable, and free from traditional middlemen like estate agencies.

This platform is built using Hardhat, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js to offer a decentralized, secure, and user-friendly experience.

🚧 **Note**: This project is currently under development.
